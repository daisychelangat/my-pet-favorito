#### {A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal,
livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances,
intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) 
and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.This website is just a sample of a pet website.It describes my personal pet.
