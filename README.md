#### {A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal,livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances,intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.This website is just a sample of a pet website.It describes my personal pet.}, {03-12-2020}

## Description{It is widely believed among the public, and among many scientists, that pets probably bring mental and physical health benefits to their owners; a 1987 NIH statement cautiously argued that existing data was "suggestive" of a significant benefit. A recent dissent comes from a 2017 RAND study, which found that at least in the case of children, having a pet per se failed to improve physical or mental health by a statistically significant amount; instead, the study found children who were already prone to being healthy were more likely to get pets in the first place. Unfortunately, conducting long-term randomized trials to settle the issue would be costly or infeasible.}
