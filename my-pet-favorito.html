        <p>I love animals. I feel like my life would be incomplete without my pet. I have one. My pet is a dog named Favorito.
             Favorito is an adorable brown dog that has a few black spots spread across his body and tail. Favorito is a kelpie crossed with a border collie, and he has fluffy velvety ears.
              Even though Favorito has a very strong body frame, he has a very gentle face and is always a friendly dog to those whom he knows. If a stranger approaches out house, however, Favorito can get very aggressive.
               He always barks loudly to attract our attention to the approaching stranger. There is one thing that I especially like about having this pet – 
               I know that my little friend will always be there for me to protect me or my family. Therefore, in some way, Favorito gives me a feeling of protection.

        <h2>Favorites of favorito</h2>
        <p>Favorito loves many things. Among these is to nuzzle his wet nose in my hands
             and in the hands of my parents and siblings.
              He craves attention most of the time because he is scared of being abandoned or ignored. I actually came across Favorito while he was still a puppy. 
              It appears his owner had abandoned him on the road. I found him wandering in our neighborhood. I informed my parents about the puppy. I wanted to keep him. 
              They communicated with the local authorities so the authorities could allow us to adopt the pet.</p>
              <p>Favorito loves food, especially bones.
                   Once we have fed him his regular food, we always give him a few bones on which to chew. 
                   Favorito can actually spend whole afternoons chewing bones because he loves them so much. Whenever he is worried, he looks at us with desperate eyes that appear as if he is sad.
                    He does so while wagging his tail from one side to the other. Whenever we see him exhibiting these signs, we immediately prepare a quick meal
                     and some bones for him to eat.</p>
                     <p>
                        Favorito has also made it a habit to play with our cat, Toppy. Sometimes, Favorito plays with  and pours 
                        out the cat’s water, something that always leaves the cat giving him a vicious glare. Sometimes, the cat even meows as if to let Tipsy know 
                        that he is not very impressed with him for pouring out his water. Whenever my dog plays with the cat’s water, I see him lifting his head as some of the cat’s water pours out from his tongue, like the way water drops from a waterfall.</p>
